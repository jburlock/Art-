<h1>Jaynie's World</h1>
<p>Here are some things that I have created!</p>
<img src="Alphabet photo project.png">
  
<p>I chose a theme and a color scheme, and then took photographs of various beauty products. Then I strategically put them together in Adobe In Design. My vision for the final composition was to display bright colors and crisp letters together in a way that made sense.</p>

<p>This was a poster I created last fall semester in my tpoygraphy class. It was to advertise a concert (that wasn't real!) at IU.</p>
