<h1>Jaynie's World</h1>
<p>Here are some things that I have created!</p>
<img src="Alphabet photo project.png">
  
<p>I chose a theme and a color scheme, and then took photographs of various beauty products. Then I strategically put them together in Adobe In Design. My vision for the final composition was to display bright colors and crisp letters together in a way that made sense.</p>

  
<img src="New Wave Poster.png">
  
<p>This was a poster I created last fall semester in my tpoygraphy class. It was to advertise a concert (that wasn't real!) at IU.</p>
  
<img src="Charcoal Drawing.png">
  
<p>This is a charcoal drawing of a palm that I drew in a class called Simulation & Reality.</p>

  Project 1 Augmented Reality. <p>

  <p> Also, here are the links to the sites I used for my research on Hoagy. The information included underneath my photos in my project
    came from here. <p>

   <h1>Experiment 2: Hypermedia Mirrors (Digital Collage)</h1>
  
  <p> Below is the link to my google drive folder that contains the materials I used for this project. It is in the folder
    labeled Project 2 P5. <p>

  <p> Also, here is the link to the sound I used in my project. It was from a youtube video that I converted and downloaded.<p>
  
  <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3L4lGo5QZ4 <p>
  
  <p> This is my physical project. If you click on vecna within the collage you will hear his signature clock sound that
    plays throughout the show. P5 decided to make it sound a bit wonky, but I think that it adds an additional funky aspect/effect to my
    project! <p>
