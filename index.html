<h1>Jaynie's World</h1>
<p>Here are some things that I have created!</p>
<img src="Alphabet photo project.png">
  
<p>I chose a theme and a color scheme, and then took photographs of various beauty products. Then I strategically put them together in Adobe In Design. My vision for the final composition was to display bright colors and crisp letters together in a way that made sense.</p>

<p>This was a poster I created last fall semester in my tpoygraphy class. It was to advertise a concert (that wasn't real!) at IU.</p>

<p>This is a charcoal drawing of a palm that I drew in a class called Simulation & Reality.</p>

<h3>Experiment 1: Augmented Graffiti</h3>
 <p> For this project I decided to augment the Hoagy Carmichael Statue that is right near the Fine Arts Building. 
  I chose to focus on this statue because I have always wondered who Hoagy was and why that statue was built and placed there. 
   After thorough research I have discovered many interesting things about him. I chose some image targets that relate to his life, 
   with a plan to tape them to the statue itself. I wanted my project to be a "Augmented Reality Biography" of
   Hoagy. So, when my viewer looks at the image targets in Unity, I want them to also get to read a bit about 
   his life. So, I added in captions underneath the photos as well.
  
  <p>Here are some of the images that I used in this project!<p>

  <h3>Experiment 2: Hypermedia Mirrors (Digital Collage)</h3>
  <p> For this project I chose to focus on the Netflix series Stanger Things for my collage. I used P5.js to create it.
  My goal was to design an 80s themed background with colors and shapes. Then, I added the photos of the different characters in the 
  show ontop. I then added in an interactive element and sound. When you click on Vecna, the eerie clock song that is used throughout
  the show, plays. I honestly don't love how this turned out. If I were to redo this project, I would add in more interactive elements.
  I originally wanted each character to have a sound once you clicked on their picture, but I sort of struggled in creating this and 
  it was difficult for me to figure out.
